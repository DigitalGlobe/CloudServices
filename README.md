# dgcs-examples

This Git repository contains some simple examples of how you can integrate the DGCS WMS and WMTS OGC services into 
a web application using the [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.1.0.html) or [Openlayers](http://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/)
APIs.

The [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.1.0.html) and [Openlayers](http://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/)
APIs offer a wide variety of features.  As the examples provided here are very rudimentary, please refer to the repective
[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.1.0.html) and [Openlayers](http://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/) API 
documentation for more thorough documentation of what can be done with these tools.

In order to access the DGCS OGC services, you will need a CONNECTID and, depending on how your account is set up, you 
may also need to authenticate with a username and password.  The CONNECTID used in these examples does not require 
authentication and only has access to very low resolution terra color imagery.
